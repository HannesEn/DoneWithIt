### Technologies
#### Node.js
Node.js is an open source cross platform Java Script runntime enviroment that is built on google chrome's V8 Java Script engine. This allows Java Script to run outside of the web development enviroment to power server side(backend), mobile apps or other non web applications with Java Script.

Java Script is a must in any web developers tool kit mainly due to its Node Package Manager(NPM) which allows developers to install many communiity build packages into their projects which add additional functionality such as Express.js or EJS. Node.js is often considered to be one of the most important project in Java Script development history.

Organisations such as Netflix, NASA, Trello, PayPal, Linkedin, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, eBay, GoDaddy and CitiBank are ussing Node.js for its versitility and efficientcy. 




#### React Native
React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook that enables developers to build native mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It offers a cross-platform approach, allowing developers to write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android platforms. React Native leverages native components and APIs, providing the performance and look-and-feel of a native app.

React Native utilizes a "learn once, write anywhere" philosophy, allowing developers with web development skills to easily transition into mobile app development. React Native offers a rich ecosystem of third-party libraries and tools, making it highly extensible and flexible. Its hot reloading feature enables rapid development and iteration, resulting in shorter development cycles.

With its popularity and robust community support, React Native has become a popular choice for building efficient and visually appealing mobile applications.




#### GitHub
GitHub is a centralized version controll, code managment and hosting platforms that allows developers to colaborate on software projects and track changes to their codebase. GitHub utilizes Git, and open source version controll system that acts as a link between the developers local repository and the cloud based repository on GitHub.

Furthermore GitHub acts as a social platform that enables developers to share their coding journey and keeps track of a developers activity, which interests companies that are looking to hire.

Out of the tens of thousands of companies that use GitHub in their tech stack some popular ones include Netflix, Airbnb, Shopify, Udemy and Reddit.

On this project GitHub was used to colaborate, keep track of changes a write documentaion. 




#### Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an open source IDE(integrated development environment) created by Microsoft which is a more lightweight version of Microft Visual Studio.

Whilst Visual Studio Code lacks low level programming capabilities(interacting directly with the hardware with languages such as C++ or Asembly) this makes it perfect for web development as developers can benifit from the softwares simple user interface, shortuts and extentions. 

Visual studio code is videly used in the industry by companies such as Google and is also in use at many universities.




#### Expo and Expo Go
Expo.dev is a comprehensive platform and toolkit designed to simplify the development process for building high-quality mobile applications. It provides developers with a streamlined workflow, allowing them to create apps for iOS, Android, and the web using a single codebase. 

Expo.dev offers a range of powerful features, including an extensive library of pre-built UI components, easy access to device APIs, and a robust development environment.

With Expo.dev, developers can quickly prototype, build, and deploy their applications, while also benefiting from features like hot reloading and instant updates.

The platform is widely used and favored by developers for its ease of use, speed, and ability to accelerate the mobile app development cycle.




### Usage
To get started follow the indroduction guide by expo(https://docs.expo.dev/overview/) Then:
  1. Install and setup Git. A guide by GitHub(https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
  2. Clone the GitHub respository. ```` git clone https://github.com/jedddg/bullying-wiki.git ```` 
  3. Open terminal, and navigate to the folder using ````cd````
  4. Check if npm is installed by running ````npm````. If not, install Node.js and NPM(https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-     node-js-and-npm)
  5. Run ````npm i````
  6. Run ````expo start````
  7. Follow the instructions in the terminal to choose how you would like to interact with the app(Note: the application is still in development and        has not yet linked all the screens together. To switch the different screens, open the project directory in the IDE of your choice, and visit          ````app.js```` at the root of the directory. In the ````App```` function chage the return variable to another screen name. The names of the            different screens can be found in ````./app/screens/```` simply ender the file name, but exclude the ````.js````.)

### Plans for the future
Although development is currently on hold, I do expect that I will continue the course and the project in the future. The course has already tought me allot about react, react native and Java Script and I truly want ot thank 'programming with mosh' for creating such a comprehesive and engaging course.


### Acknowledgements
-A paid react native course by Code With Mosh was followed in order to work on this tutorial(https://codewithmosh.com/)
-Chat GPT by open AI was used to assist with writing some parts of the documentation.
