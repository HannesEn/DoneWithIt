Java Script is a must in any web developers tool kit mainly due to its Node Package Manager(NPM) which allows developers to install many communiity build packages into their projects which add additional functionality such as Express.js or EJS. Node.js is often considered to be one of the most important project in Java Script development history. Organisations such as Netflix, NASA, Trello, PayPal, Linkedin, Walmart, Uber, Twitter, eBay, GoDaddy and CitiBank are ussing Node.js for its versitility and efficientcy. 

#### GitHub
GitHub is a centralized version controll, code managment and hosting platforms that allows developers to colaborate on software projects and track changes to their codebase. GitHub utilizes Git, and open source version controll system that acts as a link between the developers local repository and the cloud based repository on GitHub. Furthermore GitHub acts as a social platform that enables developers to share their coding journey and keeps track of a developers activity, which interests companies that are looking to hire. Out of the tens of thousands of companies that use GitHub in their tech stack some popular ones include Netflix, Airbnb, Shopify, Udemy and Reddit.
On this project GitHub was used to colaborate, keep track of changes a write documentaion.

Visual Studio Code is an open source IDE(integrated development environment) created by Microsoft which is a more lightweight version of Microft Visual Studio. Whilst Visual Studio Code lacks low level programming capabilities(interacting directly with the hardware with languages such as C++ or Asembly) this makes it perfect for web development as developers can benifit from the softwares simple user interface, shortuts and extentions. Visual studio code is videly used in te industry by companies such as Google and is also in use at many universities.
